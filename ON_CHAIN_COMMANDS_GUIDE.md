## 🔍 Understanding PDAs (Program Derived Addresses)

### What are PDAs?
PDAs are deterministic addresses derived from seeds. They're unique and predictable!

### Group PDA
```
Seeds: "GROUP_SEED" + GroupName + OwnerPublicKey
Example: GROUP_SEED + "MyCrew" + OwnerAddr...
```

### MemberProfile PDA
```
Seeds: "MEMBER_SEED" + GroupPDA + MemberPublicKey
Example: MEMBER_SEED + GroupAddr... + MemberAddr...
```

### TradeProposal PDA
```
Seeds: "PROPOSAL_SEED" + ProposerPDA + GroupPDA + Nonce
Example: PROPOSAL_SEED + ProposerAddr... + GroupAddr... + 12345
```

## 💰 Transaction Fees

### Typical Costs (Solana Mainnet)
- Create Group: ~0.01-0.02 SOL
- Join Group: ~0.005-0.01 SOL
- Create Proposal: ~0.005-0.01 SOL
- Add/Remove Trader: ~0.005 SOL
- Fetch Data: FREE (read-only)

### Fee Optimization
- Fees depend on account size
- Rent is returned when accounts close
- Batching operations saves fees

## 🎯 Workflow Example

### Complete Group Trading Flow

#### 1. Owner Creates Group
```bash
/create_group TradingMasters 20 70
```
📤 **Result:** Group PDA created, Owner is first trader

#### 2. Members Join
```bash
# Member 1
/ajo join <group_id>

# Member 2  
/ajo join <group_id>

# Member 3
/ajo join <group_id>
```
📤 **Result:** Each gets MemberProfile PDA

#### 3. Trader Creates Proposal
```bash
/propose_trade "Buy 100 BONK" <bonk_mint> <token_account> 100 buy
```
📤 **Result:** TradeProposal PDA created

#### 4. Check Proposal Status
```bash
/fetch_proposals
```
📤 **Result:** See all proposals and vote counts

#### 5. Sync to Verify
```bash
/sync_group
```
📤 **Result:** Verify on-chain state matches expectations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Insufficient funds" Error
**Problem:** Wallet doesn't have enough SOL for transaction fees
**Solution:** Send 0.1 SOL to your bot wallet address

### "User not found" Error
**Problem:** User hasn't registered with bot
**Solution:** Run `/start` command first

### "Only traders can create proposals"
**Problem:** User is a member but not a trader
**Solution:** Owner must promote you first

### "Group has no on-chain address"
**Problem:** Group was created before integration
**Solution:** Create a new group or manually migrate

### Transaction Timeout
**Problem:** RPC endpoint is slow or overloaded
**Solution:** 
- Wait and retry
- Check RPC_URL in config
- Use a premium RPC endpoint

## 🔐 Security Notes

### Private Key Management
- ✅ Keys are encrypted in database
- ✅ Decrypted only for signing
- ✅ Never exposed to users
- ✅ Use ENCRYPTION_KEY environment variable

### Best Practices
1. Keep bot token secure
2. Use dedicated bot wallets (not personal)
3. Start with Devnet for testing
4. Limit initial capital until tested
5. Monitor transaction logs

---

## 📊 State Management

### Group States (On-Chain)
```
Initialized → Trading → Voting → Ended
```

- **Initialized:** Just created, accepting members
- **Trading:** Active trading period
- **Voting:** Vote on proposals
- **Ended:** Group concluded, distribute profits

### Proposal States
```
Created → Open → Executed/Cancelled
```

---
